You are a data professional hired by a research team that is studying the relationship between head size and brain weight in a group of individuals. The goal is to analyze whether there are any significant patterns or clusters in these measurements. The team wants to use these insights to conduct further studies and better understand the factors that may influence these characteristics.

For this activity, you will have access to the dataset "headbrain.csv", which contains information on head size (in cubic centimeters) and brain weight (in grams). Your job is to use clustering techniques, especially the K-Means algorithm, to identify groups of individuals with similar characteristics.
